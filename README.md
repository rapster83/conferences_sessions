# Conferences & Sessions
This repository contains slides, templates, blueprints, charts and other related content of my sessions as a speaker on different non-commercial conferences and community events. If you are visiting this repository you might have attended one of my sessions, either remote or in-person.

You can find my presentations, slides, code examples, demos and additional created information as well as important resources around the subjects here.
The resources belonging to each talk are stored by year and event in a separate folder.
